# Art2Ascii
Soon-to-be GUI tool for converting images of many formats into ASCII art. Art2Ascii aims to be some Code Kata for me to hone my skills with respect to image processing and manipulation, as well as with Electron & Java script. The current plan is to use CImg as the imaging library as it's small and fairly easy to use, and HTML, CSS, and JS as the frontend through Eletrion.js.
