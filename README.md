# Art2Ascii
Soon-to-be GUI tool for converting images of many formats into ASCII art. Art2Ascii aims to be some Code Kata for me to hone my skills with respect to image processing and manipulation, as well as with C++ GUI toolkits. The current plan is to use CImg as the imaging library as it's small and fairly easy to use, and GTK+ as the GUI library.
